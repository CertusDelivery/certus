Certus::Application.routes.draw do
  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'deliveries#picklist'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'

  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  scope :api do
    resources :deliveries do
      collection do
        get 'picklist'
        get 'unpicked_orders'
        get 'load_unpicked_order'
        get 'sort_picking_orders'
        delete 'remove_picked_orders'
      end
    end
    
    resources :delivery_items, only: [ :show ] do

        post 'pick'
      end
      member do
        post 'substitute'
      end

  # Example resource route with options:
  #   resources :products do

  #     end
  #
  #     collection do
  #       get 'sold'
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do

  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable

  # Example resource route within a namespace:
  #   namespace :admin do
  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products
  #   end
